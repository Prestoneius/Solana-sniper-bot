Hello.

This is my Solana Blockchain new token pairs sniper bot based on Pump.fun.

The intended use of this bot is to sniper a new creation using the public Pump.fun API.

If you would like to test out my early stage bot you can continute reading on to set it up yourself.

1. Make sure you have all the depencies downloaded (refer to my .JSON files) as well as Node.js installed on your machine
2. Once you have the basics downloaded you can go over the finalBot.js file itself
3. You will have to implement your own RFC endpoint (many for free online, not the greatest quality though)
4. You will have to implement your wallets private key in order to sign transactions - or don't if you don't trust a random stranger on the internet (review the code yourself)
5. Run the code! See what happens!

Will make clearer instructions with simple copy and paste commands but its a little late right now and I just wanted to get this alpha version of the sniper bot pushed.

Feel free to post issues or send in your own changes to the project!
